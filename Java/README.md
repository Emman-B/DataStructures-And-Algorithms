# Java (DSA)
This contains Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in Java.

I used an IDE (IntelliJ) for these implementations, which is why the directory structure looks strange.

## Technologies Used
I used JUnit (v5.7.0) for writing unit tests.

I used the IntelliJ (2021.2) IDE for code writing and compilation.

## Directory Structure
All of the implementations are in the `src/com/github/emman_b/` directory.

All of the tests are in the `test/com/github/emman_b`

## Usage (Running the Tests)

Use the IntelliJ IDE to import this Java project. You can use some other IDE, but it may cause problems when building and running the tests.

From there, make sure JUnit is installed to run the tests. The IDE should be able to automatically install it.

Then, right-click on the `test` directory in the IDE and select the option to run all of the tests.
