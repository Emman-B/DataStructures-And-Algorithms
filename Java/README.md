# Java (DSA)
This contains Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in Java.

This was taken from my original repository: <https://github.com/Emman-B/DSA-Java/>. You can review the commit messages from that repository if necessary.

## Technologies Used
I used the IntelliJ (2021.2) IDE for code writing and compilation.

I used JUnit (v5.7.0) for writing unit tests.

## Directory Structure
All of the implementations are in the `src/com/github/emman_b/` directory. There are separate directories for Data Structures and Algorithms.

All of the tests are in the `test/com/github/emman_b`. This also contains separate directories for Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Usage (Running the Tests)

Use the IntelliJ IDE to import this Java project. You can use some other IDE, but it may cause problems when building and running the tests.

From there, make sure JUnit is installed to run the tests. The IDE should be able to automatically install it.

Then, right-click on the `test` directory in the IDE and select the option to run all of the tests.
